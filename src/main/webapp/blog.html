            <p>SEO Company BrightEdge unveiled new research findings on the performance of Organic and Paid
                Search as a marketing channel. The strength of search marketing - Organic Search and Paid
                Search - is clear. Organic Search remains the dominant source of trackable web traffic
                and in the dominant position as a channel. Paid Search continues to grow. Organic Social
                Media is flat since 2014 at 5%, and though ubiquitous, contributes on average 1/3 as much
                traffic as Paid Search and just 1/11 as much as Organic Search.
                Read the report to find out why the Organic Channel grew and what this means for your business.
                Download the full report to see how organic channel share has continued to dominate year after
                year.</p>
